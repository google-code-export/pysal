Next steps


## Coding
 - implement other version of fisher (done)
 - implement our own version of fisher
 - parallelize our version
 - random sampling version
 - parallelize random sampling version 
 
## Experiment
 - design experiment for comparison
 - small n
	 - compare sampling approach to brute force for accuracy tradeoff
 - large n
	 - time comparisons across the above implementations
	 
## Presentation

 - brainstorm presentation
 - 15 minutes max
