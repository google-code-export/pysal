Next Steps with PySAL
######################

Learning More
-------------
The tutorials you have (hopefully) just gone through should be enough to
get you going with PySAL.  They covered some, but not all, of the
modules in PySAL, and at that, only a selection of the functionality of
particular classes that were included in the tutorials. To learn more about
PySAL you should consult the `API <../../library/index.html>`_.


Getting Involved
----------------

PySAL is an open source, community-based project and we highly value contributions
from individuals to the project. There are many ways to contribute, from filing
bug reports, suggesting feature requests, helping with documentation, to
becoming a developer. Individuals interested in joining the team should send an
email to pysal-dev@googlegroups.com or contact one of the `developers <http://code.google.com/p/pysal/people/list>`_
individually.
