Using the PySAL Shapely Extension
#################################


Introduction
============

The Shapely project is a BSD-licensed
Python package for manipulation and analysis of
planar geometric objects, and depends on the widely used GEOS library.


Installation
============

If you run into problems with our *general* instructions below, please refer to the `Shapely <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely>`_
website for definitive instructions on installing Shapely and its
dependencies, *without which PySAL's Shapely extension will not work.*

First, on OS X, check to see if the GEOS Framework is installed at
/Library/Frameworks/GEOS.framework. If not, download and install `GEOS <http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/>`_ (Geometry Engine Open
Source) following the instructions there for your platform. 

Once GEOS is installed, use your favorite Python installation method to
install Shapely. A number of methods are illustrated `here <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely>`_.

Verify Install
--------------

Type the following into a Terminal or Shell::

  python -c 'import shapely'

If you get no complaint, continue with this tutorial.
