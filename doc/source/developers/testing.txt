PySAL Testing Procedures
************************

PySAL relies on two different modes of testing [1] integration (regression)
testing and [2] doctests. All developers responsible for given packages shall
utilize both modes.

Integration Testing
===================

Each package shall have a directory `tests` in which unit tests scripts for
each module in the package directory are required. 

For example, in the directory `pysal/esda` the module `moran.py` requires a
unittest script named `test_moran.py`. This path for this script needs to be
`pysal/esda/tests/test_moran.py`.

To ensure that any changes made to one package/module do not introduce breakage in the wider project, developers should run the
package wide test script in `tests/tests.py <http://code.google.com/p/pysal/source/browse/trunk/pysal/tests/tests.py>`_ before making any commits.

This script will run any existing unit tests as well as identify packages
missing any tests.

The trunk should most always be in a state where all tests are passed.

Docstrings and Doctests
=======================

All public classes and functions should include examples in their docstrings. Those examples serve two purposes:

#. Documentation for users
#. Tests to ensure code behavior is aligned with the documentation

Doctests will be executed when buidling PySAL documentation with Sphinx.


Developers *should* run tests manually before committing any changes that
may potentially effect usability. Developers can run doctests (docstring
tests) manually from the command line in two ways: one, if the module
includes doctest code (see below), ::

    def _test():
        import doctest
        doctest.testmod(verbose=True)

developers can run the "main" of the file
(python modname.py) and see the docstring results, as long as the call to
testmod includes the verbose flag. Two, developers can see the doctest
results for modules without a test function by running::

 python -m doctest -v modname.py
