Abstract
========

Python 2.x is being phased out in favor of the backwards incompatible Python 3
line.  In order to stay relevant to the python community as a whole PySAL needs
to support the latest production releases of Python. With the release of Numpy
1.5 and the pending release of SciPy 0.9, all PySAL dependencies support Python
3. This PEP proposes porting the code base to support both the 2.x and 3.x lines
of Python.

Motivation
==========

Python 2.7 is the final major release in the 2.x line.  The Python 2.x line will
continue to receive bug fixes, however only the 3.x line will receive new
features ([Python271]_).  Python 3.x introduces many backward incompatible
changes to Python ([PythonNewIn3]_).  Numpy added support for Python 3.0 in
version 1.5 ([NumpyANN150]_).  Scipy 0.9.0 is currently in the release candidate
stage and supports Python 3.0 ([SciPyRoadmap]_, [SciPyANN090rc2]_).  Many of the
new features in Python 2.7 were back ported from 3.0, allowing us to start using
some of the new feature of the language without abandoning our 2.x users.

Reference Implementation
========================

Since python 2.6 the interpreter has included a '-3' command line switch to
"warn about Python 3.x incompatibilities that 2to3 cannot trivially fix"
([Python2to3]_).  Running PySAL tests with this switch produces no warnings
internal to PySAL.  This suggests porting to 3.x will require only trivial
changes to the code. A porting strategy is provided by [PythonNewIn3]_.
