Abstract
========

The spatial dynamics module combines a number of previously developed and
to-be-developed classes for the analysis of spatial dynamics. It will
include classes for the following statistics for spatial dynamics, Markov,
spatial Markov, rank mobility, spatial rank mobility, space-time LISA.

Motivation
==========

Rather than having each of the spatial dynamics as separate modules in
PySAL, it makes sense to move them all within the same module. This would
facilitate common signatures for constructors and  similar forms of data
structures for space-time analysis (and generation of results).

The module would implement some of the ideas for extending LISA statistics
to a dynamic context ([Anselin2000]_ [ReyJanikas2006]_),
and recent work developing empirics and summary
measures for comparative space time analysis ([ReyYe2010]_).


Reference Implementation
========================

We suggest adding the module ``pysal.spatialdynamics`` which in turn would
encompass the following modules:

* rank mobility
* spatial rank mobility
* Markov
* Spatial Markov
* Space-Time LISA
