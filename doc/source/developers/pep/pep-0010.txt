Abstract
========

A pure Python implementation of an Rtree will be developed for use in the
construction of spatial weights matrices based on contiguity relations in
shapefiles as well as supporting a spatial index that can be used by GUI based
applications built with PySAL that requiring brushing and linking.


Motivation
==========

As of 1.1 PySAL checks if the external library ([Rtree]) is installed. If it
is not, then an internal binning algorithm is used to determine contiguity
relations in shapefiles for the construction of certain spatial weights.  A
pure Python implementation of Rtrees may provide for improved cross-platform
efficiency when the external Rtree library is not present. At the same time,
such an implementation can be relied on by application developers using PySAL
who wish to build visualization applications supporting brushing, linking and
other interactions requiring spatial indices for object selection.


Reference Implementation
========================

A pure Python implementation of Rtrees has recently been implemented ([pyrtree]) and
is undergoing testing for possible inclusion in PySAL. It appears that this
module can be integrated into PySAL with modest effort.
