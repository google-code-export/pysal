Installation Notes for PySAL


Dependencies:
=============================================================================
Python 2.5+

Numpy

Scipy

spatialindex 1.3.0 (Rtree dependency)
http://trac.gispython.org/spatialindex
license: lgpl

Rtree:
url: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Rtree/0.4.1 
license: lgpl


Mac OS X Notes
=============================================================================
(charlie add here)


Linux Notes
=============================================================================
On Ubuntu (Jaunty Jackalope) install requires a patch of spatial index,
patch is at: http://trac.gispython.org/spatialindex/attachment/ticket/11/gcc43.diff

then apply the patch in the parent directory of spatial index as follows:

	patch -p0 < gcc43.diff

You also need the python-dev package installed: apt-get install python-dev

If you want to work on a local development copy (and not do a system level
install of pysal, do the following)

cd $pysalroot
python setup.py build
cp build/lib.linux-i686-2.6/pysal/core/_shp.so pysal/core/.

And, also see below on setting the PYTHONPATH environment variable.

On Ubuntu (Hardy Heron) install is fairly straightforward. Python-dev has to
be installed and the dynamic library path set.

Windows XP Notes
=============================================================================
To create the Windows installer...
Build the module on a Windows machine (python setup.py build --compiler=COMPILEROFCHOICE).
Generate the installer from the build (python setup.py bdist_wininst).

For COMPILEROFCHOICE, mingw32 seems to work well.  Install MinGW and make sure c:\mingw\bin is in your PATH (environmental variables in system properties).


In order to build and install spatialindex, the same compiler used to build
the Python in question has to be available. Not having VC++7 available, sjr
set up cygwin and used its gcc compiler to build a new python and successfully
compile spatialindex and rtree.

Numpy and scipy still need to be built under this platform.  Finally Tk and
TCL have to be built and Python redone in order to have Tkinter available.
Unfortunately Tk and TCL require the MS VC++7 compiler so we are dead in the
water here.


Developer Notes
=============================================================================
If you wish to work on pysal without installing it as a site-package then the
following setp is necessary
 
Add a path to the trunk in your PYTHONPATH environment variable. On Mac OS
this can be done in your .bashrc file:

export PYTHONPATH="PATHTO/pysal/trunk"

where PATHTO is where you pulled the svn down to.
