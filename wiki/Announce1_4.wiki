#release announcement for 1.4
== PySAL 1.4 Released (2012-07-31) ==

On behalf of the PySAL development team, I'm happy to announce the
official release of PySAL 1.4.

PySAL is a library of tools for spatial data analysis and
geocomputation written in Python. PySAL 1.4, the fifth official
release of PySAL brings the following key enhancements:

   *  spatial regression (spreg):
        * Integration of scipy.sparse structures in all the regression classes
        * Probit
        * Probit with diagnostics for spatial effects

  *  exploratory spatial data analysis (esda):
        * Generalized Gamma statistics for spatial autocorrelation

  *  spatial dynamics (spatial_dynamics):
        * O(n log n) algorithm for spatial tau (spatial rank correlation)
        * LISA Markov transitions and tests for spatial dynamics

  * computational geometry (cg) and spatial networks
        * efficient point to nearest LineSegment search
        * generate network topology from shapefiles
        * utilities for interfacing with networkx
        * integration of network cluster code (beta)

among the 155 commits and bug fixes since the last release, 6 months ago.
