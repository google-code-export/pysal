#summary How to build PySAL distributions

= Introduction =

This page explains how to build source and "binary" distributions of PySAL. 

= Source Distros =

The work of specifying files and folders to include in a PySAL source distribution has been done.  These things are specified in setup.py and MANIFEST.in.  To build a new source package, run {{{python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar,zip}}} to generate two source distributions. 

A good reference is http://docs.python.org/distutils/sourcedist.html

= Binary distros =

==Windows==
Build distribution installers for Windows on Windows machines to ensure that the proper dynamic libraries are included in the distributables.  There are two Windows installer formats.  The MSI installer allows the user to specify the location to install PySAL, whereas the .EXE offers a choice based on the registered Python executables found on the host system.

  * Run {{{python setup.py bdist_wininst}}} to build the .EXE graphical installer. 
  * Run {{{python setup.py bdist --formats=msi}}} to build the MSI installer . 

==OS X Darwin==
To make a Mac OS X graphical installer, first install 'bdist_mpkg' from the Python Package Index ( try  {{{pip install bdist_mpkg}}} or {{{easy_install bdist_mpkg}}}). 

Next, build the package by running {{{bdist_mpkg setup.py build}}}, which builds your package installer in the dist/ directory.  *The mpkg will need to be modified to install to the correct location.* _Replace wildcards below with actual filenames_.

  # Edit {{{pysal*.mpkg/Contents/Info.plist}}} replacing the path under {{{IFRequirementDicts}}} which a generic System path such as, {{{/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib/python2.6/site-packages}}}.  This will check that directory exists before installing.  Note that {{{Version/Current/lib/python2.6}}} is a work around to support both system python and EPD.  
  # Next find and edit {{{pysal*.mpkg/Contents/Packages/pysal*.pkg/Contents/Info.plist}}}.  Change the value after {{{IFPkgFlagDefaultLocation}}} to point to {{{/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib/python2.6/site-packages}}}  
  # Next, convert that file (ending in ".mpkg") into a disk image suitable for distribution by executing the following command: {{{hdiutil create -fs HFS+ -srcfolder pysal*.mpkg/ pysal-x.x.x-py2.X-macosx10.X.dmg}}}
