How to build pysal distributions

= Introduction =

This page shows how to build source and binary distributions of pysal. 

= Source Distros =

The work of specifying files and folders to include in a pysal source distribution has been done for you.  These things are specified in setup.py and MANIFEST.in.  As a new packager, all you have to do is run {{{python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar,zip}}} to generate two source distributions. 

A good reference is http://docs.python.org/distutils/sourcedist.html

= Binary distros =

Making a Windows binary, with a not-so-shabby installer, is not too difficult as long as we rely on the user to provide the package dependencies.  Run {{{python setup.py bdist_wininst}}} to generate a Windows executable.
