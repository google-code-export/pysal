#summary An Overview of the FileIO system in PySAL.

= Introduction =

PySAL contains a new file input-output API that should be used for all file IO operations. The goal is to abstract file handling and return native PySAL data types when reading from known file types. A list of known extensions can be found by issuing the following command.

{{{
>>> pysal.open.check()
PySAL File I/O understands the following file extensions:
Ext: '.shp', Modes: ['r', 'wb', 'w', 'rb']
Ext: '.shx', Modes: ['r', 'wb', 'w', 'rb']
Ext: '.geoda_txt', Modes: ['r']
Ext: '.dbf', Modes: ['r', 'w']
Ext: '.gwt', Modes: ['r']
Ext: '.gal', Modes: ['r']
Ext: '.csv', Modes: ['r']
Ext: '.wkt', Modes: ['r']
>>>
}}}

Note that in some cases the FileIO module will peek instead your file to determine it's type. For example "geoda_txt" is just a unique scheme for ".txt" files, so when opening a ".txt" pysal will peek inside the file to determine it if has the necessary header information and dispatch accordingly.  In the event that pysal does not understand your file IO operations will be dispatched to python's internal open.
