=PySAL 1.3 Released (2012-02-01)=

On behalf of the PySAL development team, I'm happy to announce the
official release of PySAL 1.3.
PySAL is a library of tools for spatial data analysis and
geocomputation written in Python. PySAL 1.3, the fourth official
release of PySAL, includes a number of new features and enhancements:

   * The spatial regression module (spreg) has added:
       * Two Stage Least Squares
       * Spatial Two Stage Least Squares
       * GM Error (KP 98-99)
       * GM Error Homoskedasticity (Drukker et. al, 2010)
       * GM Error Heteroskedasticity (Arraiz et. al, 2010)
       * Spatial HAC variance-covariance estimation
       * Anselin-Kelejian test for residual spatial autocorrelation
of residuals from IV regression
       * New utility functions and other helper classes
   * A new contrib module to support user contributed modules. The first
     contributed modules are:
       * Weights Viewer – A Graphical tool for examining spatial weights
       * World To View Transform – A class for modeling viewing
windows, used by Weights Viewer
       * Shapely Extension – Exposes shapely methods as standalone functions
       * Shared Perimeter Weights – calculate shared perimeters weights


along with many bug fixes and smaller enhancements.
