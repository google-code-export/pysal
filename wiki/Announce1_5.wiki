= PySAL 1.5 Released (2013-01-30) =

On behalf of the PySAL development team, I'm happy to announce the
official release of PySAL 1.5.

PySAL is a library of tools for spatial data analysis and
geocomputation written in Python. PySAL 1.5, the sixth official
release of PySAL brings the following key enhancements:

===spatial regression (spreg)===

Adding regime classes for all GM methods and OLS available in pysal.spreg,
i.e. OLS, TSLS, spatial lag models, spatial error models and SARAR models. All
tests and heteroskedasticity corrections/estimators currently available in
pysal.spreg apply to regime models (e.g. White, HAC and KP-HET). With the
regimes, it is possible to estimate models that have:

 * Common or regime-specific error variance; Common or regime-specific
 * coefficients for all variables or for a selection of variabels Common
 * or regime-specific constant term Various refactoring to streamline
 * code base and improve long term maintainability

===FileIO===

  * support for kwt

===contrib modules (sandbox modules, not in core)===

  * shapely 
  * mapping
  * network
  * spatial databases

among the 116 commits and bug fixes since the last release, 6 months ago.
