On behalf of the PySAL development team, I'm happy to announce the
official release of PySAL 1.2.

PySAL is a library of tools for spatial data analysis and
geocomputation written in Python. PySAL 1.2, the third official
release of PySAL, brings a number of new features:

    * Directional (Space-Time) LISA Analytics
    * LISA Markov Spillover Test
    * Spatial Markov Homogeneity Tests
    * Markov Mobillity Indices
    * Support for a wide variety of spatial weights formats including
        * AcGIS SWM, Text, DBF
        * STATA
        * MATLAB MAT
        * MatrixMarket MTX
        * Lotus WK1
        * DAT
        * and others
    * RTree spatial index
    * Getis-Ord G statistics for global and local autocorrelation
    * Optimized conditional randomization for local statistics
    * Optimized Block/Regime Spatial Weights
    * Thin Spatial Sparse Weights Class (WSP)

along with many smaller enhancements and bug fixes.
