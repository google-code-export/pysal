=PySAL 1.0 Released=

We are pleased to announce the release of PySAL 1.0.0. 

PySAL is a library of tools for spatial analysis written in Python. 
This 
release comes after an extensive integration and refactoring effort to 
combine 
common analytical functionality in the projects STARS and PySpace into 
a shared 
open source library for geospatial analysis and geocomputation. For 
more 
information, please see the release notes that follow below. 

You can download PySAL from here:

Python 2.6 binaries for Windows and OS X are available, as well as 
source 
tarballs for other platforms and documentation in html form. 

Enjoy, 

The PySAL developers
