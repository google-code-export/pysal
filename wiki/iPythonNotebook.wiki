IPython notebook
================

----

Functionality
=============

**Basic functionality**

    * **Pretty** way to alternate inline code, inline output (including graphs) and text (markdown) in one document
    * **Share** the document (``ipynb``) with others and allow them to **modify** it
    * **Export** the document to html or pdf to allow "read-only" access
    * Although it is a browser based GUI, it has several **key bindings** that
      make working on notebooks much more comfortable and make it a real
      option for presentations, teaching, etc.

**Unexplored features**

    * Import of existing scripts
    * Executing/importing notebooks as python files
    * Running public notebooks in a server
