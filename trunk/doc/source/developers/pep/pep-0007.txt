Abstract
========

The spatial econometrics module will provide a uniform interface to the
spatial econometric functionality contained in the former PySpace and
current GeoDaSpace efforts. This module would centralize all specification,
estimation, diagnostic testing and prediction/simulation for spatial
econometric models.


Motivation
==========

Spatial econometric methodology is at the core of GeoDa and 
GeoDaSpace. This module would allow access to state of the art
methods at the source code level.


Reference Implementation
========================

We suggest adding the module ``pysal.spreg``. As development
progresses, there may be a need for submodules dealing with
pure cross sectional regression, spatial panel models and spatial probit.

Core methods to be implemented include:

   * OLS estimation with diagnostics for spatial effects
   * 2SLS estimation with diagnostics for spatial effects
   * spatial 2SLS for spatial lag model (with endogeneity)
   * GM and GMM estimation for spatial error model
   * GMM spatial error with heteroskedasticity
   * spatial HAC estimation

A significant component of the effort for this PEP would consist of
implementing methods with good performance on very large data
sets, exploiting sparse matrix operations in scipy.
