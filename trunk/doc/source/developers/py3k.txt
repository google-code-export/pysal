PySAL and Python3
=================

Background
----------

PySAL Enhancement Proposal #9 was approved February 2, 2011. It called for
adapting the code base to support both Python 2.x and 3.x releases. 

Setting up for development
--------------------------

Setup for ipython3 by first getting distribute from PyPi::
 
 curl -O http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py
 python3 distribute_setup.py

After distribute is installed, get pip::

  curl -O https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py
  python3 get-pip.py

Now that you have pip, get iPython::

 # Use pip from the Python3 distribution on your system
 /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.2/bin/pip install ipython


Get numpy and scipy installed (from source) for Python3. Download source
tarballs, cd into the trunk, and run python3 setup.py install. Post issues to
the pysal-dev mailing list
