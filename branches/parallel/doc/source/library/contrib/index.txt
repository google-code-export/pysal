:mod:`pysal.contrib` -- Contributed Modules 
===========================================


**Intro**

The PySAL Contrib library contains user contributions that enhance PySAL, but
are not fit for inclusion in the general library. The primary reason a
contribution would not be allowed in the general library is external
dependencies. PySAL has a strict no dependency policy (aside from Numpy/Scipy).
This helps ensure the library is easy to install and maintain.

However, this policy often limits our ability to make use of existing code or
exploit performance enhancements from C-extensions. This contrib module is
designed to alleviate this problem. There are no restrictions on external
dependencies in contrib. 

**Ground Rules**

 1. Contribs must not be used within the general library.
 2. *Explicit imports*: each contrib must be imported manually.
 3. *Documentation*: each contrib must be documented, dependencies especially.

**Contribs**

Currently the following contribs are available:

 1. World To View Transform -- A class for modeling viewing windows, used by Weights Viewer.

    - Path: pysal.contrib.weights_viewer.transforms
    - Requires: None

 2. Weights Viewer -- A Graphical tool for examining spatial weights.

    - Path: pysal.contrib.weights_viewer.weights_viewer
    - Requires: wxPython
